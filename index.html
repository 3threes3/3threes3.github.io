          Hi there! My name is David and I'm a second year student of Web Application Development at <a href="http://www.institutosanjuandelacruz.com/" style="color: rgb(36, 208, 90);">IES San Juan de la Cruz</a>. 
          I enjoy designing algorigthms and will be starting an internship at <a href="https://clarity.ai/" style="color: rgb(36, 208, 90);">Clarity</a> around the second trimester of 2020 (unless COVID says otherwise!).

          Hi again! Thanks for your interest in knowing a bit more about me. My name is David and I'm a second year student of Web Application Development 
          at <a href="http://www.institutosanjuandelacruz.com/" style="color: rgb(36, 208, 90);">IES San Juan de la Cruz</a>.  Before, I studied Nursing at 
          University of Salamanca but I came to the conclusion it wasn't a good choice for me. 
          <br>
          I've lived for a bit over three years in the UK before coming to Spain and I worked multiple jobs; like packer at a warehouse for 
          <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/publishers/Littlehampton-Book-Services-Ltd" style="color: rgb(36, 208, 90);">Littlehampton Book Services</a> and as a 
          Customer Service Agent at <a href="https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/" style="color: rgb(36, 208, 90);">Vision Direct</a>. I was shortly promoted into the departament of
          Business Analysis where I was in charge of two other colleagues. As I started playing around with data, I rekindled my love for programming I once had when I was very young. 
          <br>
          This prompted me into looking at possibilities to pivot my professional career towards programming and here we are.
          <br>
          I'm in the middle of setting up a <a href="https://davidlorenzo.substack.com" style="color: rgb(36, 208, 90);">newsletter</a> in which I'll be including some of the interesting things I come accross
          the internet or any thought that crosses my mind in my daily life. I'm in love with the game of chess although I'm a bit rusty as I've not had much time to play in the last couple of years. Please send me 
          an email if you want a casual game; I'll be happy to obligue!
